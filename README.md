I coded in JavaScript a function that randomly generates a password based on user chosen criteria. The criteria was a minimum character count of 8 and a max of 128 as well as having options to choose numbers,special characters, upper and lowercase letters or a combination. The user is prompted when they click the generate button to accept that they are going to choose password criteria, then as they respond their answers are validated.
